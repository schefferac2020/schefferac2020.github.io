I am an incoming PhD student in the [AI Lab](https://ai.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan advised by [Prof. Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/). I earned my BSE (2020-2023) and MSE (2023-2024) at the University of Michigan. 

If interested, you can [download my CV here](../files/CV.pdf).

What I'm Doing Now
======
<br>
I'm **extending my internship at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory** throughout this school year. I'll continue working on the surface simulation stacks for the [Mars 2020](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/overview/) mission, the [Mars Sample Return](https://mars.nasa.gov/msr/) mission, and the soon-to-be-launched [CADRE tech demo](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/game_changing_development/projects/CADRE). 

I'm working as a **researcher in the Intelligent Robotics and Autonomy Lab (IRAL)** under professor [Vasileios Tzoumas](https://vasileiostzoumas.com/). Right now, we're developing and testing stable controllers for a drone with additional degrees of freedom for each propellor. 

I'm **completing my master's in Computer Engineering with a focus on robotics**. This semester, I'm enrolled in Mobile Robotics (ROB 530), Marine Robotics (ROB 572), and Action & Perception (EECS 598) at UofM.
