<br>
I am an aspiring computer scientist and roboticist looking to work on interesting problems! I've just finished my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://www.engin.umich.edu/). Currently, I'm working towards my master's degree at UofM in Computer Engineering with a focus on robotics. 

If interested, you can [download my resume here](../files/resume.pdf).

What I'm Doing Now
======
<br>
I'm extending my **previous summer internship at NASA JPL** throughout this school year. I'll continue working on the surface simulation stacks for the [Mars 2020](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/overview/) mission, the [Mars Sample Return](https://mars.nasa.gov/msr/) mission, and the soon-to-be-launched [CADRE tech demo](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/game_changing_development/projects/CADRE). 

I'm working as a **researcher in the Intelligent Robotics and Autonomy Lab (IRAL)** under professor [Vasileios Tzoumas](https://vasileiostzoumas.com/). Right now, we're developing and testing stable controllers for a drone with additional degrees of freedom for each propellor. 

I'm currently **pursuing a master's in Computer Engineering with a focus on robotics**. This semester, I'm enrolled in Mobile Robotics (ROB 530), Marine Robotics (ROB 572), and Action & Perception (EECS 598) at UofM.

I'm the previous **software lead for Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (MAAV)** and a current member. In this project team, we design, program, and test software code for a completely autonomous on-board flight system. 

I'm an advisor for the **Michigan Hackers iOS Team** after being a lead for two years. Michigan Hackers is the largest Computer Science club on campus with over 150 active members. On the iOS subteam, we work to teach, develop, and deploy iOS apps using Xcode and Swift. Check out some of the cool projects we've worked on in the Projects tab!
